	<p>Do you remember this background? Our little library.<br>Oh those memories. Always loved it whenever I remember.<br>A waterbender, rice lover, potterhead and introvert you are.<br>I'm not sure what to say really, just too glad that I have ya.<br>Ever since the day you came into my life, it's gotten better, way too much really.<br>It was almost shocking that human can actually be like you. Thank you. For Everything.
